                    <p class="text-muted">Our labeling system was created on the hypothesis that by providing people with information when they need it and where they need it, they will make more informed and sustainable decisions. The labels reflect whether an item has a ‘high’, ‘medium’ or ‘low’ environmental impact within its product category and is placed next to price tags in grocery stores. The goal is to influence food consumption behaviour and promote alternatives that are better for the environment.</p> <br>
