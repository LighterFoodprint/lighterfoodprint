		                <p class="text-left my-4">Food production accounts for over <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987">a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions</a>, and half of the world’s habitable (ice and desert-free) land is used for agriculture. The urgency of the climate crisis and the significant impact that food has on greenhouse gas emissions means that food services and consumers have an important role to play in their food choices, by creating demand for less carbon-intensive foods. By providing transparency on the carbon emissions of food by using menu labels, consumers will be able to make more climate-informed choices. A 2020 survey found that consumers were in support of carbon labelling on products across all countries, with two-thirds of consumers saying they think it is a good idea (<a href="https://www.carbontrust.com/resources/product-carbon-footprint-labelling-consumer-research-2020">The Carbon Trust, 2020</a>).
                        <br><br>We believe the value of carbon labelling can extend to restaurant menus too.  Our vision is that the resulting shift in demand away from carbon-intensive foods will lead to food services offering more low-carbon alternatives. Other restaurants around the world are starting to put climate labels on their food, such as <a href="https://newsroom.chipotle.com/2020-10-26-Chipotle-Launches-Real-Foodprint-Introduces-Sustainability-Impact-Trackers-For-Digital-Orders">Chipotle</a> and <a href="https://justsalad.com/carbonlabel">Just Salad</a>. Now is the perfect time to get ahead!

		                <p class="text-left my-4">Incorporating sustainability into your business model isn’t only great for the environment, it is also becoming widely accepted as a necessity for long-term business success. Today’s consumer wants to know where their food comes from, how it was produced, and, increasingly, what sustainability factors were included in the process (<a href="https://farrellymitchell.com/greater-food-supply-chain-transparency-is-good-for-business-and-consumers/">Farrelly & Mitchell, 2019</a>). According to the <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/report/2015/the-sustainability-imperative-2/">Nielsen Company</a>, 74% of Millennials and 72% of Gen-Z consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable products and services. Moreover, as the City of Vancouver is investing in and prioritizing becoming the “<a href="https://vancouver.ca/green-vancouver/greenest-city-action-plan.aspx">greenest city</a>”, having a sustainable business strategy will put businesses in line with where municipal investments and community sentiment are heading. 
                        <br><br>By implementing a sustainable business model, we can help your business turn sustainability into a viable brand strategy for more sustainability-minded audiences, increasing your presence in the community, and improving long-term sales. In addition, understanding changing environmental regulations will allow your business to create long term risk mitigation strategies. Regulations like the <a href="https://www.ccme.ca/en/resources/waste/waste/plastic-waste.html">Canada-wide ban</a> on single use plastics and the <a href="https://vancouver.ca/green-vancouver/single-use-items.aspx">Vancouver-wide ban</a> on single-use styrofoam containers pose additional threats to small businesses. With sufficient foresight, these can become opportunities to lead by example and become trend setters in the industry. Responding to heightened social, governmental, and consumer attention on the broader impact of the environment nowadays demonstrates how a sustainable business model is a competitive advantage. It’s a win-win for you, our community, and for the environment.

		                <p class="text-left my-4">Currently, there are 508,700 small businesses in BC, representing 98% of all businesses <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/employment-business-and-economic-development/business-management/small-business/sb_profile.pdf">Small Business Profile 2020</a>). Though smaller in size, these small businesses grow at the same rate as large businesses (14.4%). In addition, small and local businesses are usually the first market players to adapt to local consumer demand. They make decisions that reflect local community priorities and are nimble enough to make immediate changes. However, they are also the most vulnerable and among the first to be impacted by economic troughs. This year, they have been hit particularly hard by COVID-19. Between July 7th and July 13th, 2020, 78% of B.C. small businesses reported lower sales volumes due to COVID-19. This is higher than the 75% reported for the business sector as a whole. We want to help build a thriving local economy that reflects community concerns for the climate by providing pro-bono consulting services that provide sound strategy and sustainability advice.
